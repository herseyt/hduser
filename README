Hello Drew -

This is my first attempt at a Git repository project.

Hopefully this will successfully save to GitHub.


Here are some notes on my hadoop installation:

Running Hadoop

To get yourself off the ground, go ahead and run the following commands:

Format the Hadoop Namenode using:
hadoop namenode -format


Start Hadoop by running the script:
/usr/local/Cellar/hadoop/1.1.1/libexec/bin/start-all.sh


Run some quick tests
hadoop dfs -ls /

cd /usr/local/Cellar/hadoop/1.1.1/libexec
hadoop jar hadoop-examples-1.1.1.jar pi 10 100


Don’t forget you can access the Map Reduce Admin and HDFS Admin through the web browser

http://localhost:50030 – Map Reduce Administrator
http://localhost:50070 – HDFS Administrator
 

To Stop Hadoop
/usr/local/Cellar/hadoop/1.1.1/libexec/bin/stop-all.sh

Streaming Hadoop

/usr/local/Cellar/hadoop/1.1.1/libexec/contrib/streaming/hadoop-streaming-1.1.1.jar

Look at files (output for example)

hadoop dfs -cat /user/hduser/gutenberg-output/part-00000
